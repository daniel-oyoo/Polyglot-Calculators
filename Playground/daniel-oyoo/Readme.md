# Simple Interest Calculator

## features
- Takes user input for principal, rate, and time
- Calculates simple interest using the standard formula
- Calculates total amount (principal + interest)
- Displays results in a clean, formatted way

##  Formula
[Explains the mathematical formula used]
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100  
Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest

Where:
- **Principal**: Initial amount of money [Bold text for emphasis]
- **Rate**: Annual interest rate (in percentage)
- **Time**: Time period (in years)

##  How to Run

### Prerequisites
[Lists what you need before running the program]
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Any text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

### Steps to Run:
[Numbered steps for users to follow]
1. **Save the program** as `SimpleInterestCalculator.java` [Bold for important actions]

2. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SimpleInterestCalculator.java
### Sample results
   ```bash
   === SIMPLE INTEREST CALCULATOR ===
Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter annual interest rate (%): 5
Enter time period (in years): 3

=== CALCULATION RESULTS ===
Principal Amount: $1000.00
Annual Interest Rate: 5.00%
Time Period: 3.00 years
----------------------------
Simple Interest: $150.00
Total Amount: $1150.00





### Possible Enhancements
[Ideas for extending the program - shows it's scalable]

- Adding input validation [Prevents incorrect inputs]

- Allowing different time units (months, days) [More flexibility]

- Adding compound interest calculation [Extra functionality]

- Creating a GUI version [Visual interface]
